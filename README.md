# StarTanker
Senior Design Project

Senior Design Project The StarTanker project is a prototype autonomous satellite refueling drone designed to extend the operational lifespan of satellites by replenishing their fuel in orbit. The project involved developing control scripts to manage the refueling process, conducting fluid flow analysis with ANSYS for system optimization, and creating 3D mechanical models and electrical CAD drawings using SolidWorks and KiCad. The team collaborated to design a custom cold-gas propulsion system for precise maneuvering and developed a servo-actuated ball valve for accurate fluid control. This innovative project showcases expertise in mechanical design, fluid mechanics, and control systems to address a critical need in space technology.

This file contains one script that I wrote for manually testing the servo-actuated ball valves.
